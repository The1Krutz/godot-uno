# godot-uno
Uno game in Godot

## The plan

1. Convert some of the helper models from the old React version of this since they might still be useful
2. Learn enough Godot UI to slap together a basic card game interface
3. ???
4. Profit!

## Structure

### UnoGame

The Godot project with the actual game in it

### UnoLib

Helper classes and data models that support Uno but are agnostic to Godot

### UnoTest

Tests for the helper stuff, and possibly the actual game if I can get a Godot unit testing framework to play nice
